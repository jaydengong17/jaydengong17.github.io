These past 3 classes,
we didn't do much
except for review and take quizzes.

We learned:
Solving non-linear equations,
finding x-intercepts and y-intercepts
of a quadratic graph,
finding the vertex
of a quadratic graph,
and factoring sum and difference of cubes.

### Solving Non-Linear Equations

This might seem like
a completely new concept,
but it's actually pretty simple
to do if you know how to factor.

First, you isolate all of the terms
on one side.
That means that the other side will be $$0$$.

If you factor something,
you have a bunch of terms on one side,
all multiplied together.
Because all of these terms
multiplied together equals $$0$$,
one of the terms must equal $$0$$.

From there, you can use casework
on each term to see what x would have to be
if that term is $$0$$.
Once you repeat for each term,
you have all of the possible solutions.

### Finding Stuff on a Quadratic Graph

The graph equation looks like this:
$$y =$$ quadratic.

#### Finding x-intercepts

To find the x-intercepts,
we need to find points
such that $$y = 0$$.

If we plug this into the equation,
we see that we need
to find $$x$$
where $$0 =$$ quadratic.
We already know how to do that,
we just solve the quadratic.

#### Finding the vertex

Generally, a quadratic equation
looks something like this
(it might be lower and have 2 intersections,
higher and have 0 intersections, or
be upside down):

The vertex is the place
where the quadratic starts
to go the other way.

One thing you may notice
about quadratics
is that they are symmetrical
about the y-axis.
It makes sense that the vertex
is on the line of symmetry
if you look at the image,
so the x-coordinate will be
the average of the roots,
or $$\frac{r + s}{2}$$.

I don't know if I mentioned this before,
but the sum of the roots is $$\frac{-b}{a}$$.
This is because the expansion
of $$(x-r)(x-s)$$ is
$$(x^2 - (r + s)x + rs)$$,
so $$b$$ is $$-(r+s)$$.
If $$a$$ isn't $$0$$,
this rule still works.

We can see that the average of the roots
has the sum of roots in it,
so we can substitute our expression in:
$$\frac{r+s}{2} = \frac{\frac{-b}{a}}{2} = \frac{-b}{2a}$$.

Then, we can plug this in to find the y-coordinate.

### Factoring Sum and Difference of Cubes

I already covered this in
[Intuition: Multiplying Polynomials](

### Conclusion

Sorry for not posting for 3 classes,
but we didn't do much learning,
so I decided to not post until now.

I don't know what we'll be doing
for the rest of this unit
or what the next unit to be,
but definitely stay around
for completing the square
and the quadratic formula.
