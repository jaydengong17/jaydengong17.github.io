I went to the orthodontist. Anyway, I don't know what the difference between dentist and orthodontist is. My best guess is 'the dentist fixes individual teeth and the orthodontist fixes all of them'(again, don't use that because there's probably a better way to say that).

I just searched up the definition of dentist and orthodontist, and it turned out orthodontist is literally a dentist who treats irregularities in the teeth and jaws, while a dentist is a person who can treat diseases in the teeth and gums.
