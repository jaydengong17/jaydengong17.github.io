8/15: I went to school. Today was the first day of school. Lots of talking and prep work. Bad school day overall.

8/16: I still went to school. Same as yesterday. Still lots of talking but less prep work.

8/17: Ok, you get the idea. I still went to school. Less talking and prep work.

8/18:  I went to a before school club. I had to wake up a hour early. 

We got a double P.E. period!(double P.E. is two P.E. periods squished together.) Other than that, pretty much no more talking or prep work.

8/19: Actually a regular school day! Everything about it was regular.
