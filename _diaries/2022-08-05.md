I made stock simulator money. For some reason, the seven stocks(I mean shares of stocks) made about $15.5 and not a single one of them went down in price. Yesterday I forgot I had $100,000 so I spent it very sparingly. That led to today my dad telling me to buy more (my $15.5 could have easily been $155).

(its a money thing because I can't draw the face in the middle.)
