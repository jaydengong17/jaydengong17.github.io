I went to camp. It was new classes for a new week, and they were pretty good.

I had to leave early for a doctor's appointment. Last Monday (7/11/2022) I fell and my left forearm hurt. I didn't know this until today, but I might have hairline fractured my left forearm. I got an x-ray two days later, and nothing was broken. The thing is, the doctor confused my growing bone for a spur(because bones start as cartilage and cartilage isn't visible on a x-ray, and since it starts growing on the outmost part of the bone, it looks like a spur).  So I'm not supposed to play sports in caution of falling and breaking my bone because of my maybe hairline fracture.
