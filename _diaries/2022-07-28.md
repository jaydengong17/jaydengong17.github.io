I have a basketball scrimage.

# Update 1:

The score is unreliable. I forgot that the coach changes the score to tied when there is 1 minute left. Anyway, it was 35-30 us even after the score was changed.

```
      _______
   ,-'\  |  /'-,
  /   |  |  |   \
 |    |  |  |    |
|-----|--|--|-----|
 |    |  |  |    |
  \   |  |  |   /
   '-,/__|__\,-'
```

(I think that this should be better)
