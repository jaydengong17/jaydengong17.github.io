I cut myself. No, it wasn't a bad cut. How? Well, I was just swinging a golf club when it was wrenched sideways and gripped on my left hand too well, which caused it to rupture the skin and cut me. Lesson learned: always use gloves while swinging a golf club. (yay I didn't use 'I went to (modifier) camp.' even though I did)

(really, though, I don't know what to laugh out loud about)
