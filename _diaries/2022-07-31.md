I did yesterday, 7/30/2022. As you may have noticed, today is labeled as yesterday because I did yesterday and then forgot about today. (It's really hard to write about this in present tense when I know that everybody reading knows that this is past tense.)

Just don't look at that <ins>*plane*</ins>. (wow popping that word up really does work)
