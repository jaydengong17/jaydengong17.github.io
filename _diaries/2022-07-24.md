I went to Topgolf. It's a place where you go to a first, second, or third story balcony and hit golf balls in a game. My friends and I did three things: closest to the hole, scramble, and topgolf (that's a game, not the name of the place). In closest to the hole, I hit a tree and got a bad score(I might've won if not for that unlucky bounce). In scramble, I teamed up with one of my friends and played against my other friends and one of their dads(2v3(we were the 2))(we barely won). In topgolf, my friend's dad dominated with me getting second. We were under very high tension because my friend wanted Minecraft on his new pc and had to get half or more than his dad to get it(he got it, with 36 score. His dad got 72). 

I went to Great America. I met up with my friend, who interestingly was at Topgolf with me, and with his friends from basketball.
