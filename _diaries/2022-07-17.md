I met up with some of my old friends from like, 2nd grade(at this time, 4 years). They moved to Seattle some years ago and are coming to play a water polo game. I haven't started watching them play yet.

# Update 1:

Okay, the score was 11-7 ... the other team. (By the other team, I mean the team my friends weren't on.)
