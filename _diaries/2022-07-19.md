I got my passport. The passport was a renewal. Okay, there's probably a legal word for it just because, so don't use my word choice. My mom was probably relieved because we're going on a trip(on second thought, that trip isn't in the near future, so forget about it). 

I went to camp. I had the same classes since it's still the same week, and they were still pretty good. Nothing really *important* happened there.

I bet nobody can guess what this is supposed to mean.
