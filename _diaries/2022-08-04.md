I made an Investopedia account. Unluckily, it was somewhere around 9:00 pm when I started it, so I couldn't trade any stocks(I could place orders for stocks when the stock market opens, which was a little weird). It turned out to be a very confusing thing.

(Yes, I did go to camp(just because there isn't a paragraph doesn't mean I didn't do it))
