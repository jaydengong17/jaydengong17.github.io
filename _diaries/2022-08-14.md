We went to Toronto. On the trip there and back, we were delayed by 2 hours or more. We went to a bunch of adult places(I think they're boring). The good part was that my friend also came, and we played a lot of video games.

The adult places that we went to are:

The museum.

The CN tower. We also ate on top of it.

(Looking at) the old city hall.

If I remember correctly, the only castle in North America. I jumped over a new renovated wall, so I can now say that I jumped a castle wall.

Niagara Falls (behind the falls and under the falls). That really wasn't an adult place.

(yeah, that really wasn't much)
