This week, I went to the Nueva summer camp.
My morning class was game design, which used scratch.
Scratch was already too simple for me,
so I decided to try to one-up myself by attempting to create a 3D renderer,
which I've never done successfully before. 

In my past attempts, I searched up things randomly and tried to find something that would work.
This time, I tried to think about it, and I came up with something really simple.
I decided to make a youtube video about this, to try to educate people with not only the equations,
but also how you get to that equation.
