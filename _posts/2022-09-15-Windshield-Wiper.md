I did get this idea from looking at the windshield wipers in the car.
Later, while talking to my dad, he said that, to him, they didn't look misaligned. 
This is my opinion on this topic.

I assumed that the radius is the same for both wipers. Also, the windshield wiper's centers are offset by 0.5. (made in Desmos Graphing Calculator)

If you look at it, you can already see that it looks misaligned (at least to me), but if you look at it another way, they do have the same offset.

Looking at that, the width is always the same, but the my mind is different. This is what I think my mind is thinking.

The green area represents the unwiped area, the red represents the windshield wiper on the left, and the unfilled part represents the other windshield wiper. The red area is over the other area because I usually saw the misalignment when the windshield wipers had just come down. This is probably because they stop at 90Ëš when they go up, which means that they do not overlap on the other side. 


Luckily, Desmos calculates intersections. Finding the lengths of the segments gave:


|At a slope of:|0|0.2|0.5|1|2|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Length:|0.5|~0.485|~0.422|~0.288|~0.108|

Or, in a visual form, the segments plotted out.

The slopes aren't equal intervals, but they are pretty close. If they were angles, it would be more accurate. Even so, this shows my mind's interpretation.
