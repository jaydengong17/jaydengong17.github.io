My dad and I were talking in the car
about "the creativity of people"
and how they never seem to run out
of new genres of music.
I also had this thought before,
so I decided to make this scientific.

I'm going to judge music types off of three things:

melody presence: how much melody is present

drum/beat presence: how much drum/beat is present

and lyrics: how much lyrics there are
<!--excerpt-->
<br>

This is technically a three-dimensional grid of possibilities,
so I'm going to try to nest some lists.

Top is: drum/beat presence

Side is: melody presence

Inside lists are: lyrics (in the form: high, medium, low)

<br>

|- - -|high|medium|low|
|high|pop, heavy metal, swing?|pop?, electronic music, lo-fi & swing?|soft rock, ???, classical|
|medium|rap + pop, pop, easy listening?|vocal & hip hop, blues, k-pop, jazz & dance band|musical theatre, folk, ragtime|
|low|rap, rap, garageband beat maker|rock, k-pop?, ???|not a song|

Actually, it looks pretty filled out.
Just saying, I don't know much about music theory (is that a thing?),
so I'm probably missing a lot of things
and placing a bunch of the things in the wrong places.

The choices visible here are:

low beat, high melody, medium lyrics and
medium beat, low melody, no lyrics

If you want to pioneer a new music age, maybe try those choices!
