I made an argument for the popular question, "Which came first? The chicken or the egg?".

<!--excerpt-->

I think the egg came first.

There are two ways to solve this question: a cheesy way and a real way.

##The cheesy way:

The egg evolved about 325 million years ago. the chicken evolved about 1 million years ago. This is possible because the egg we are talking about is not from a chicken.

##The real way:
If the egg came first, then it would be easy to biologically mutate the southeast asian red junglefowl to become the chicken because you only need to mutate one cell.

On the other hand, if the chicken came first, then it would need to somehow mutate all of its body's cells (a.k.a. cancer) while not killing itself. This doesn't make sense, because the cancer only originates from one type of cell.(for example, a chicken would not be able to live if it was made up of only mutated muscle.) 

(I just realized this argument (at least the real way) is false, since if we are talking precision, then even a single dna changing could push the average similarity from a southeast asian red junglefowl over to a chicken.)
