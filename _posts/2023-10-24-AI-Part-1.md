I am trying to write an AI.

I wanted to just start programming, but my dad was a lot more sensible and
recommended that I try to watch this guy, [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy),
so that I could learn the basics. My dad then realized that I didn't even know
what dot products were, so I just kept watching the playlist,
[The Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) by 3Blue1Brown,
which I had already started.

I probably know more than I need to about dot products to do this, because the main
use for dot products in AI (from my limited knowledge of both subjects) is just multiplying
a lot of stuff.

Didn't do anything interesting yet.
