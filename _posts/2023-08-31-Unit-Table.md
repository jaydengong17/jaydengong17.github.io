I recently made a table for all of the
base SI units per second (to the power of 0, 1, 2, and 3).
I got this inspiration from [xkcd.com/2813/](https://xkcd.com/2813/).

## The Actual Table

| SI unit Per | 1 | sec | sec^2 | sec^3 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|**sec**|sec|1|frequency|???|
|**meter**|m|velocity|acceleration|jerk|
|**ampere**|A|???|???|???|
|**kilogram**|kg|mass flow rate|spring stiffness|energy density stuff|
|**candela**|cd|something is gaining brightness so that you will be permanently blind in ~ 6 hours|???|???|
|**kelvin**|K|cooling rate|something is cooling more quickly every second by 1K|???|
|**moles**|mol|rates of various chemistry/biology things|???|???|

There are many places filled with question marks.
