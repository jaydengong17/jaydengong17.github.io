<strong> WARNING: IF YOUR COMPUTER IS AN OLD POTATO LIKE MINE, I DO NOT RECOMMEND CLICKING ON THIS PAGE.

I made an interesting simulation of slime mold. First, the simulation creates a lot of agents.
These agents each have a x position, a y position, and a direction, which points to one of the eight surrounding squares.
At each timestep, the agents compare the amount of pheromone
in the direction it is facing and the two neighboring squares.
Then, it turns in that direction and might turn randomly, and then moves in that direction.
After it is done, it leaves the maximum amount of pheromone on the square it is currently on.
Then, the pheromone on each square is depleted by 1 unit, and then the next timestep starts.

The original idea came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A&t=961s.
