I am trying to write an AI.

I wanted to just start programming, but my dad was a lot more sensible and
recommended that I try to watch this guy, [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy),
so that I could learn the basics. My dad then realized that I didn't even know
what dot products were, so I just kept watching the playlist,
[The Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) by 3Blue1Brown,
which I had already started.

I probably know more than I need to about linear algebra to do this, because the main
use for linear algebra in AI (from my limited knowledge of both subjects) is just taking dot products.

Didn't do anything interesting yet.
