The front page is getting overwhelmed with all of the code,
so to view the calculator,
you have to click more.

<br>
This is my polynomial division calculator.
Please only use spaces, "x"s, "^", and numbers.
My calculator takes inputs in standard form,
or polynomials of the form, 
$$a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$$.
It can handle duplicate terms with the same degree,
but not much else out of standard form.

Usually there is an explanation here,
but I already made a post about it
[here](https://www.jaydengong.com/intuition/2024-01-19-Polynomial-Division.html).
