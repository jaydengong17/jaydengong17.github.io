I was trying to learn morse code,
which I did with the [google thing](https://morse.withgoogle.com/learn/).
This did teach me morse code, but I wanted to get faster at it,
and the google thing got slightly annoying,
so I tried searching for it elsewhere.
I didn't find anywhere good,
so I decided to make my own.

While I was doing this, I needed a list of common words,
but a lot of those lists were kind of political,
so I decided to use the old list of all possible wordle answers.
So, I guess this is kinda a wordle trainer now as well?

Todo: add sound, add auto-submit
